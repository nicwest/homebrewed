Ink Witch
=========

You have become a doorway to the shadow plane. The shades of monsters and fallen gods are looking for freedom and scrape at the corners of your mind. Pacts are forged; service in exchange for a moment's release. You bind their souls to your body with ink and needle and unleash  them on your enemies.

Skin Deep
---------

Starting at 1st level you learn to temporarily bind the shades of the shadow plane to your body by tattooing their visages into your skin. You have 15 feet of skin on your body that can be utilised at any one time and you may bind as many shades as you have room for on your body. It takes 1 hour to find a specific shade and seal it into your flesh.

As an action on your turn you may release a shade from the shadow plane, the ink in your skin dissolves and the shade materialises 5ft in front of you. While you have a shade active, you must remain immobile, and must maintain concentration on controlling it. If you lose concentration the shade and it's image return to your body. 

The shade once summoned shares your initiative and uses your spell modifier for its AC, attacks, saving throws and ability checks. When first bound to your body the shade gains temporary hit points equal to 3 times your warlock level. On reaching 0 hit points the shade fades back into the shadow plane and it's tattoo must be redrawn or replaced with that of another shade. 

Each shade has different actions and can perform one action and one reaction on its turn.

On your turn you may use an action to return the shade to your body. You may not attack or cast spells while a shade is active.
