Ink Witch
=========

You have become a doorway to the shadow plane. The shades of monsters and
fallen gods are looking for freedom and scrape at the corners of your mind.
Pacts are forged; service in exchange for a moment's release. You bind their
souls to your body with ink and needle and unleash them on your enemies.

Skin Deep
---------

At 1st level you learn to temporarily bind the shades of the shadow
plane to your body by tattooing their visages into your skin. You have 15 feet
of skin on your body that can be utilised at any one time and you may bind as
many shades as you have room for on your body. It takes 1 hour to find a
specific shade and seal it into your flesh (see the list at the bottom of this
subclass).

As an action on your turn you may release a shade from the shadow plane, the
ink in your skin dissolves and the shade materialises 5ft in front of you.
While you have a shade active, your movement speed is reduced by half, and
you must maintain your concentration on controlling it. The summoned creature
will not move more 120 feet away from your body. If you lose concentration the
shade and it's image return to your skin. 

The shade once summoned shares your initiative and uses your spell modifier
for its AC, attacks, saving throws and ability checks. When first bound to
your body the shade gains temporary hit points equal to 4 times your warlock
level. On reaching 0 hit points the shade fades back into the shadow plane and
it's tattoo must be redrawn or replaced with that of another shade. 

On your turn, you can verbally command a shade where to move (no action
required by you). You can use your action to verbally command a summoned shade
to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don't issue a
command, the creature takes the Dodge action. If you are able to make multiple
attacks you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command a shade to
take the Attack action.

Shadow Tamer
------------

Starting at 6th level you have learned to focus your control of the creatures
of the shadow plane. With a shade already active, you may summon an additional
shade as a bonus action. You are now able to concentrate on controlling two
shades at the same time and may issue a command to both shades as a single
action.

Protection of The Doorway
-------------------------

At 10th level your body has become a haven for many powerful shades and they
will not tolerate it being damaged beyond repair. When you have less than half
hit points and take damage, a shadow creature will leap to your aid, you may
roll 2d4 and reduce the damage taken by that amount. You must have a least one
shade tattoo still on your body or be within the melee range of an active
shade.

Darkness Unleashed
------------------

On reaching 14th you feel naked without at least one or two shades crawling in
you skin and whispering in your mind. You are beginning to embrace the
darkness, and the maximum number of shades you may have summoned at any one
time is increased to 3.

Additionally as an action you may choose to temporarily relax your grip on the
door. All remaining shades erupt from your flesh, appear within 5ft of you,
and you immediately lose control of all summoned shades. The shades continue
to share your initiative but take actions on their own behalf and towards
their own ends. After 1 minute the shades dissipate and return directly to the
shadow plane. You may not add more tattoos to your body until your finish a
long rest.
