Wander
======

Usually trained with regular melee weapons, a chance encounter with an
ancient wand unearths the long lost art of wizard duelling. This
archetype makes use of borrowed magic to become a close range arcane brawler. 


The wand chooses the wizard
---------------------------

At level 3 a mysterious wand comes into your possession. The wand has 2
charges and regains 1d4 charges every day at dawn. You may expend 2 charges to
cast [chaos bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/chaos-bolt) at first level.

The wand may also make a special ranged spell attack where the damage deals
1d8 fire damage. Whenever you cast chaos bolt from the wand, the damage type
of this attack changes to match the damage from chaos bolt.

The spell modifier for any spell cast using this wand is intellect.

Magical Brawler
---------------

Starting from level 3 you learn the art of close range wizard dueling. All
wands are considered light melee weapons, and you are proficient with them.
Ranged spell attacks cast with wands, within 5ft don't impose disadvantage,
and may use your attack action.

Familiar Fingers
----------------

By level 7 the wand has gotten to know your touch. Regardless of the distance
between you and your wand, so long as it is on the same plane of existence,
you may click your fingers and the wand will fly quickly back to your hand.

When either you or the wand are physically restrained from being reunited,
roll 1d12, on a 12 the wand uses any remain charges to teleport directly into
your reach.

Secrets found
-------------

At level 10 you have gleaned enough arcane knowledge from the wand to start
exerting some control of its deeper powers. You can now expend two of the
wands charges as a reaction to cast

You may also learn a cantrip from the wizards spell list that can only be cast
with the wand.

Finally your wand gains 1d6 charges at dawn instead of the original 1d4.

Spell consumption
-----------------

On reaching 15th level you discover that the wand can permanently learn new
spells by consuming scrolls. In order to cast the spell you must expend
charges relative to the spells level.

Additionally the wand now regains 1d8 charges everyday at dawn .

Powerful bond
-------------

By level 18 the wand has become tangled with part of your life force. If you
are reduced to 0 hit points the wand may expend all remaining charges (min 1)
to restore you to 1hp.

In addition your wand now regains 1d10 charges at dawn.
