School of Matches
=================

Practised far and wide among hedge witches and wise men, matchstick magic is
equal parts arcane knowledge, superstition, and trial and error. While most
wizards discard matchstick magic as hokuspokus used to trick unsuspecting
minds, you have delved deeper into the matchbox than most and have started to
find it's true power. You scratch your nail down the matchstick head and the
world burns.

Pyromancer
----------

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must
spend to copy any spell with a name containing "fire", "flame", "flaming",
"scorch", "sear", "burn", "heat", "dark", or "incendiary" into your spellbook
is halved.

Matchbox
--------

When you reach your 2nd wizard level you gain access to an enchanted matchbox
with 1d4 magic matchsticks in it. Once per long rest you can spend 1 hour
refilling your matchbox by rolling your matchstick dice (shown in the table
below). Any matchsticks leftover from a previous refill lose their potency,
but they can still function as ordinary matches and are visibly and tangibly
different to the magical matchsticks.

Your matchbox is immune to water and fire damage and will not open for anyone
but you.

If you lose your matchbox you can spend 1 hour enchanting a new matchbox.

Matchsticks
-----------

Starting at level 2, using a match as part of the components for a spell adds
+1 to your spell attack modifier, and +1 damage to your spells.

You must have at least one hand free in order to retrieve and light a match.
Lighting the matchstick acts as both the somatic and verbal components of a
spell. Additionally the matchstick counts as any material component of a spell
without explicit value.

Match Magic
-----------

Starting at level 6, as an action on your turn, you can cast any spell that
has "fire", "flame", "flaming",  "scorch", "sear", "burn", "heat", "dark", or
"incendiary" in it's name, at it's lowest level, without spending a spell
slot, at the cost of 2 matches per spell level (1 match for a cantrip)

Fine Matches
------------

Starting at level 10, when using a matchstick from your matchbox as a
component in order to cast a spell you may add your intelligence modifier to
the damage of that spell.

Additionally your matches function underwater and in the windiest of
environments.

Devils on the head of a match
-----------------------------

Starting at level 14, as an action on your turn, you can use all of your
remaining matchsticks (minimum of 1) at once to cast conjure elemental at 5th
level. The spell summons a number of elementals equal to the number of matches
used. The summoned elementals are always
