*wonderous item, uncommon* 

These two brass knuckle dusters have a  stubby cannon barrel on mounted on
each digit. Your finger cannons have 2 charges that recharge after a short
rest. When you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you may expend 1 charge
to fire the finger cannons on the punching hand and deal 2d4 force damage in
addition to your regular attack damage.
