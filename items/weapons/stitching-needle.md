*+1 dagger, rare*

This long, thin dagger resembles a large sewing needle. A thick black thread trails from the dagger's hilt and disappears into a project dimension. When you hit a creature or construct with this weapon you may attempt to stitch the target to either another target within 5 feet or to itself. The target must make a dexterity saving throw (DC 15), or become grappled (escape DC 13), if the target is already grappled it will become restrained (escape DC 15). 

> Stitch, stitch, stitch,</br>
> As I sew you to the wall.</br>
> Stitch, stitch, stitch,</br>
> Now so slow, I kill you all.
