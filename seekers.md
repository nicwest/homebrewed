*dart, rare*


You find a bandleier of 4d4 throwing darts. Each dart contains a malevolent spirit bound in its core. Evily barbed and beatle black, the seekers hum with the rage of their imprisionment. They seek two things: to earn their freedom and to do as much damage as they can on the way out.

You may throw the dart and it hits a target of your choice  that you can see within range. The dart deals 1d4 piercing damage + your ability modifier. When you roll a 4 on the damage dice the seeker deals an additional 4 force damage. When you roll a 1 on the damage dice the seeker shatters on impact freeing the spirit inside and rendering the dart unrecoverable.

As an action you may call for any lost darts to return to you. A recalled dart takes the most direct route to your bandleier and moves of its own volition 

> Kaylee peaked around the edge of the temple door at the goblin raiding party blocking their exit. A hail of arrows followed her retreating head.
>  "7 on the left, 5 on the right" she muttered to the quavering priest next to her.
>  From a leather belt slung across her chest Kaylee filled her hands with a number of angry looking darts, took a deep breath, and dashed from one side of the door to the other. As she did so, in a flurry of movement so fast the eye could barely follow them, she doing the darts into the room. 
> The preist heard multiple noises in quick succession: an unearthly buzzing, followed by shrill screams, and the sound of several small bodies hitting the stone floor. Finally, though quietly, he thought he heard someone whisper a single word: "freedom!".
> Kaylee looked back over to him briefly and then more to her self than anyone else she said "3 on the right, 2 on the left"
